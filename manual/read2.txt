@CHAPTER HEAD = Background information and terms

<$M[Backinf]>Some background information and definitions are required 
to understand some of the parameters used by <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>. 
The next two sections are background information.

@SECTION HEAD = The <$IStd><BI>Std<D> and <$ITran><BI>Tran<D> abbreviations 
as used in <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>

In <$M[Std]>3780 two different framing formats are used to transmit 
files. The standard format is fine for sending text files but cannot 
transmit certain special characters (the data gets confused with the 
protocol's framing characters). The transparent format can send all 
possible characters. <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> transmits and recognizes 
either format and allows different buffer translations of each. The 
abbreviations <MI>Std<D> and <MI>Tran<D> are used throughout <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> 
to refer to standard and transparent framing formats, respectively.

@SECTION HEAD = The names <$IVary><BI>Vary<D>, <$IFixed><BI>Fixed<D>, 
<$IBinary><BI>Binary<D> and <$IHex><BI>Hex<D> as used in <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>

<$IBuffer;Translation>An <$M[Vary]>actual 3780 workstation formats 
the data buffers somewhat differently in transparent mode than in 
standard mode. The standard mode sends variable length records separated 
by record separator characters with consecutive spaces compressed. 
This buffer format is referred to in <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> as <MI>Vary<D> 
(short for variable).

The format most commonly used in transparent mode sends all 80 characters 
in a record and does not send record separators or perform space compression. 
This mode is referred to as <MI>Fixed<D>. Both <MI>Vary<D> and <MI>Fixed<D> 
formats use the <$IEBCDIC;Buffer Conversions>EBCDIC character set 
(<$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> performs ASCII/EBCDIC translations when 
sending or receiving).

Another commonly used format is one in which ASCII data is sent and 
received from the PC without being converted. This will be referred 
to as <MI>Binary<D>. <MI>Binary<D> data should normally be sent transparently 
since invalid characters may be in the file. The transparent <MI>Binary<D> 
mode can be used to send executable files from one PC to another. 
Many emulators use this format including UDS' <169>Bsc<170> and AST 
Research's 3780. Many IBM mainframes are also set up to receive in 
this mode (including the IRS').

<$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> has a buffer format called <MI>Hex<D>. This 
mode transforms <$IASCII;Buffer Conversions>ASCII pairs into bytes 
and vice versa. It is primarily useful as a diagnostic tool. This 
is not a true trace in that the 3780 framing and control characters 
are not written out.
