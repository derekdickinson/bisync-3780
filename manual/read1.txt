@CHAPTER HEAD = General Information

<$M[Geninfo]>This is a manual for the the <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> 
software from D3 Softdesign. It is intended to augment the UDS Dial 
manual. This manual contains enough information to operate and (hopefully) 
customize <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> for your application. First, a 
little about what <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> does and its intended applications.

<$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> works with Universal Data Systems' Sync-Up 
modems to emulate an IBM 3780 work station. It should work with any 
device that follows IBM's Bisynch 3780 protocol and is operating over 
a compatible modem. For the sake of brevity, I will refer to an IBM 
3780 work station or any device that emulates a 3780 work station 
as merely a <169>3780<170> for the remainder of this document.

The current version of <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> can work by itself 
or in conjunction with UDS' dialer which is included on the <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> 
disk. <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> has built in dialing and auto answer 
capabilities but the setting of the modem options is not convenient 
(the options must be entered in hexadecimal) without using UDS' dialer.

The files on your <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> disk are:

@BULLET = <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>.EXE

@BULL DES = The <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> 3780 emulator

@BULLET = <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>.CFG

@BULL DES = The configuration file

@BULLET = PACKINST.EXE

@BULL DES = A program for additional customization

@BULLET = MODEMS.DTA

@BULL DES = Modem design information 

<$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> is normally sold with script files that customize 
it for a specific application. The <169><$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780><170> 
name is changed and the end user does not get script writing information. 
This document is for someone who is setting up the scripts to work 
with their application.
