D3-3780 Preliminary Read me File

Note: This document is a hodge-podge of notes.  Some of these will be in
      the user manual and some will be in technical documents or appendices.
      Therefore, the level of assumed knowledge will vary greatly from
      section to section.

1.0 General Information

This is a readme for the alpha site D3-3780 software from D3 Softdesign.  
It is intended to augment the UDS Dial manual.   The readme should
contain enough information to operate D3-3780.  First, a little about what
D3-3780 does and its intended applications.

D3-3780 works with Universal Data Systems' Sync-Up modems to emulate an IBM
3780 work station.  It should work with any device that follows IBM's
Bisynch 3780 protocol and is operating over a compatible modem.  For the
sake of brevity, I will refer to an IBM 3780 work station or any device that
emulates a 3780 work station as merely a "3780" for the remainder of this
document.

The current version of D3-3780 can work by itself or in conjunction with
UDS' dialer which is included on the D3-3780 disk.  D3-3780 has built in
dialing and auto answer capabilities but the setting of the modem options
is not convenient (the options must be entered in hexadecimal) without using 
UDS' dialer.  Convenient commands to support the setting of modem options 
will be added to D3-3780 shortly.

The files on your D3-3780 disk are:

  README.DOC      This file.
  D3-3780.EXE     The D3-3780 3780 emulator.
  D3-3780.HLP     Dummy help file for emulator (the helps are not helpful).
  SU.EXE          The UDS dialer.
  SU.HLP          The dialer's help.
  D3.BAT          Batch file which runs the dialer and then automatically 
                  runs D3-3780 if the connection has been established 
                  successfully.
