3.0 The Default Command Screen

This version of D3-3780 is strictly command driven.  An alternate (menu-
driven) interface will be offered in addition.  The command driven interface
can be used in either interactive or batch mode.  The interactive mode takes
commands from the keyboard and the batch mode takes commands from a text
file.  An example of the command driven D3-3780 Screen appears below:

The boxes at the top of the screen contain status and configuration 
information the area below it is a window which scrolls as commands are
entered and information displayed (like the example directory).  The last
line is for additional status information (with "Online" written on it).

Starting at the top of the screen I'll explain the different parts.  The 
top box contains the time, date, current directory and a copyright message.

Actual 3780 workstations have a printer and, optionally, a punch.  A host or
other 3780 device can specify which destination a transmission will be sent 
to.  D3-3780 maintains separate configuration information for each of these 
psuedo-devices.  

The two boxes to the lower left (with "Punch File" and "Print File" in the 
corners) display configuration information on the psuedo-printer and psuedo-
punch.  The designations "Print File" and "Punch File" mean the filename to
which the printer or punch data will be sent.  The word "CON" can be used in
this place to have incoming data sent to the screen.  

Below the file designations are the "Std", "Tran" and "Auto-Name" 
indicators.  These are the buffer formatting and auto-naming options.
The possible values for the buffer format options are: "Vary", "Fixed",
"Binary" and "Hex".  These values are described in section 2.2 above.
The Auto-Name option determines if separate files will be concatenated
or whether a new extension will be created for each reception.  If yes
an extension of "000" will replace a non-numeric extension and after that
the extension will increment with each new file that is received.  Otherwise,
additional files will be appended to the earlier files.

The box to the right of the printer box (with "Send File" in it) contains
status information for the file being sent.  The send file itself displays
the name of the file being transferred or "CON" if a message is being sent
from the command prompt.  The "Mode" indicates whether the transmission is
standard or transparent ("Std" or "Tran") and what buffer translation 
technique is being used ("Vary", "Fixed", "Binary" or "Hex").  To the right
of this is the indicator of whether the file is being sent to the remote's
printer or punch.

Below the sending box is a status box with some values in it.  These values
are sending status when sending and receiving status when receiving.  The 
"Rs" in the upper right hand corner of this box indicates that the data is
for "R"eceiving in "s"tandard mode.  There will always be either an R or S 
(receive or send) as the first character and an "s" or "t" (standard or 
transparent) for the second character.  Additional information can be
obtained using the "ST"atistics command.

  Bytes Sent/Received: This is the number of bytes sent or received in the 
    last or current reception or transmission (the number is updated during 
    the reception).  This number is not be very meaningful if the receive 
    filename is "CON".  In this case, the remote will send each message as 
    if it were a complete file.

  # of Blocks : This is the number of blocks (chunks of data) received
     or transmitted to the receive or transmit filenames.  These
     numbers are updated dynamically.  The number will increment
     when the block is stored to disk in the receive case or when
     the block is taken from the disk in the send case.

  # of Naks : This is the number of Naks (No acknowledgments) sent
     or received.  A Nak is a message sent by the receiving computer 
     when an error is detected in a transmitted block.  The number of 
     Naks will normally be quite small unless the telephone line 
     quality is poor.

  # of Enquiries : An enquiry is sent under two circumstances:(1)
     when a request is made to initiate a transmission, and (2)
     when data is missed and one end asks for re-transmission.  If
     nothing is missed during an entire transmission then this
     number will be 1.  The number of enquiries should be small.

The large open are below this boxes is the dialogue area in which commands can
be typed or displayed and various other messages will appear.  The "?" is 
used as the prompt.  This prompt is similar to the DOS prompt in that 
commands are typed in with parameters and then the Enter key is pressed to
cause the command to be processed.  The interface differs from DOS in several
detailed ways.
