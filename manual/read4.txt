@CHAPTER HEAD = Interactive Command Line Interface

<$M[Intcom]><$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> has an interactive command line 
interface and a script interpreter for running unattended. These two 
are very similar in that most of the commands can be used in either 
one. 

@SECTION HEAD = <$IEditing Keys>Interactive Editing Keys

<$M[Edkeys]><$SF1;Editing Keys><$SF3;Editing Keys><$SF5;Editing Keys><$SF10;Editing 
Keys><$SBackspace;Editing Keys><$SLeft Arrow;Editing Keys><$SRight 
Arrow;Editing Keys><$SHome;Editing Keys><$SEnd;Editing Keys><$SInsert;Editing 
Keys><$SDelete;Editing Keys><$SEsc;Editing Keys>When you are at the 
<$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> prompt there are several editing keys at 
your disposal. Some of these are similar to DOS' keys but differences 
exist. Here is a list of each key and its function:

@LIST EDGE IND = F1

@LIST ITEM = This key has the same function as it does in DOS. It 
will copy the previous command a character at a time.

@LIST EDGE IND = F3

@LIST ITEM = This key has the same function as it does in DOS. It 
will copy the portion of the previous command which is to the right 
of the cursor to the current line.

@LIST EDGE IND = F5

@LIST ITEM = Abort command but store command so that F1 and F3 will 
bring it back up.

@LIST EDGE IND = F10

@LIST ITEM = Delete the entire command.

@LIST EDGE IND = Backspace

@LIST ITEM = Moves cursor back (left) one position and deletes the 
character to the left of the original cursor. This is identical to 
DOS.

@LIST EDGE IND = Left Arrow

@LIST ITEM = Moves the cursor back (left) one position but does not 
delete the prior character. In DOS, this key operates just like the 
backspace key.

@LIST EDGE IND = Right Arrow

@LIST ITEM = Moves the cursor right one position unless you are already 
at the end of the command.

@LIST EDGE IND = Home

@LIST ITEM = Bring the cursor to the beginning of the command.

@LIST EDGE IND = End

@LIST ITEM = Bring the cursor to the end of the command.

@LIST EDGE IND = Insert

@LIST ITEM = Toggles Insert/Overwrite mode. Normally, if a letter 
is typed while the cursor is over a character in the command the new 
letter will be inserted. This is insert mode. If <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> 
is in overwrite mode the old character is replaced with the new one. 
The cursor will appear as a large flashing block in overwrite mode.

@LIST EDGE IND = Delete

@LIST ITEM = Delete the character over the cursor.

@LIST EDGE IND = Esc

@LIST ITEM = A general abort from any type of failed operation. Will 
abort a command in the middle of it but will not store the command 
like the F5 key. In this respect the key resembles DOS' use of it.

The individual commands that are specific to the interactive mode 
will be explained in the command summary.

@SECTION HEAD = Delimiters

<$M[Dels]>Certain characters are used to separate parameters<$IParameters;Separating> 
in the commands. These characters are generally used in the same ways. 
They are not always interchangeable. These characters are:

@LIST EDGE IND = <169> <170> (space)

@LIST ITEM = Normal delimiter used to separate command and first parameter.

@LIST EDGE IND = <169>,<170> (comma)

@LIST ITEM = Interchangeable with a space as far as <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> 
is concerned.

@LIST EDGE IND = <169>;<170> (semicolon)

@LIST ITEM = Used for optional parameters that modify mandatory parameters.<N>The 
semicolon is used in commands that take a set of parameters to set 
options that affect the parameter before it. See the <169>s<170> and 
<169>rite<170> commands.

@LIST EDGE IND = <169>+<170> (plus sign)

@LIST ITEM = Used for commands that have a variable number of parameters.<N>Most 
commands will actually take a blank or comma also but the plus accurately 
describes the behavior.

@LIST EDGE IND = <169>=<170> (equal sign)

@LIST ITEM = Indicates either equality or assignment depending on 
the command. Used only in script commands.
