@CHAPTER HEAD = The <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>.CFG file and its options

<$M[Confile]><$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> will automatically look for 
a configuration file. This file is a setup script file which contains 
things like the default screen. <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> will look 
for the configuration file first in the current directory and then 
in the directory which contains <169><$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>.EXE<170>. 
If the file doesn't exist then a default setup is used.

<$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> will look for a file with the base name of 
its executable (originally <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>) and the extension 
CFG.

The configuration file is fundamentally another script file. However, 
there are a couple of significant differences:

@OUTDENT ITEM = The most significant difference is that when the configuration 
file begins operation the modem has not been initialized in any way. 
However, the MSETH command can be used in the configuration file to 
initialize the modem.

@OUTDENT ITEM = All video writes are automatically suppressed when 
the configuration file begins operation. The UNSUP and UNDSP commands 
can be used to turn on video writes. If you intend to use direct video 
writes within the script file then the UNDSP function must be performed.

@OUTDENT ITEM = The branching is done using the slow <169>searching<170> 
technique rather than the faster table based technique (see Section 
<$R[S*,Bvars]5.1> on the MB variable). The branching technique cannot 
be changed within the file.

@OUTDENT ITEM = Assigning values to the SF (script file name) and 
DP (Dash Parameter) status variables will have the desired effect. 
These variables should only be read in a normal script file. This 
allows <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780> to run any script file without (DOS) 
command line parameters.

Typically, this file will be used to save and restore the startup 
screen and cursor location and to load the direct video screen and 
the format strings for the status variables. The configuration file 
itself can contain the direct video screen and format strings. See 
the descriptions of the LSCRN and LSTVS options to see how this is 
done.

@SECTION HEAD = Changing the Package and Configuration filenames.

<$M[Chanames]>There is a utility program named PACKINST.EXE available 
to people with strong desire to customize <$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>. 
This program allows you to install the name of the configuration file 
permanently by modifying the executable program itself. Run PACKINST.EXE 
from DOS with no parameters and it will ask for three strings:

@OUTDENT ITEM = The package name is the first parameter it will ask 
for. This value is used in place of the <169><$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780><170> 
string in all prompts throughout the package. If the package name 
were <MI>packname<D> then the executable file should be <169>PACKNAME.EXE<170>, 
the help file <169>PACKNAME.HLP<170> and the default script file <169>PACKNAME.SCR<170> 
(used if -F is not followed by a filename). The package name is case 
sensitive since it is displayed in several places in the program.

@OUTDENT ITEM = The startup (or configuration) filename is the second 
parameter which is asked for. This name is normally, <169><$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>.CFG<170>. 
Any name can be used instead.

@OUTDENT ITEM = The third value is the name of the executable in which 
to install the first two values. If you have renamed the package from 
<169><$R[V*,Packname]D3-3780>.EXE<170> then the new name should be 
entered here. Otherwise press enter.

The installation modifies the executable file itself but does not 
affect the time stamp of the executable file. The time and date values 
can still be trusted.
